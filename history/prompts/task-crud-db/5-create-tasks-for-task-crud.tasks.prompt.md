# Create tasks for task CRUD implementation

## Prompt Text


## Response Text
Created a comprehensive tasks.md file for the Todo App Phase II Task CRUD & Database Integration feature. The file contains 90 detailed implementation tasks organized into 10 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup - Project initialization tasks
2. Phase 2: Foundational Components - Core models, database, and auth setup
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create New Task (P1 priority)
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - View Personal Tasks (P1 priority)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Update Task Details (P2 priority)
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 - Mark Task as Complete (P2 priority)
7. Phase 7: User Story 5 - Delete Tasks (P3 priority)
8. Phase 8: User Story 6 - View Individual Task (P3 priority)
9. Phase 9: Validation & Testing - Comprehensive testing tasks
10. Phase 10: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns - Final preparations

Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. The tasks are organized by user story priority and include dependency information, parallel execution opportunities, and independent test criteria for each phase.

## Outcome
Successfully created a detailed task breakdown that enables incremental, testable implementation of the Todo App Phase II backend functionality. The tasks are structured to support progressive enhancement and can be executed in parallel where dependencies allow.
