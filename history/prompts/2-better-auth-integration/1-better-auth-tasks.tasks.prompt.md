# Better Auth Integration Tasks Generation

## Prompt Text
```
C:\Users\mariy\OneDrive\Desktop\Hackathon II\specs\2-better-auth-integration
```

## Response Text
Generated comprehensive tasks.md file for Better Auth integration feature, organizing implementation work into 7 phases:
1. Setup - Environment and dependency configuration
2. Foundational - Core authentication infrastructure
3. US1 - User Registration and Signup Flow
4. US2 - User Login and Authentication Flow
5. US3 - Protected Resource Access Control
6. US4 - Unauthorized Access Prevention
7. Polish - Cross-cutting concerns and final integration

The tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential IDs, parallelization markers, and user story labels. Each task includes specific file paths and implementation details to enable immediate execution by an LLM.

## Outcome
Successfully created a detailed tasks.md file with 46 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of the Better Auth integration feature.

## Evaluation
The generated tasks align with the feature specification and plan, covering all required functionality including JWT token validation, user isolation, and proper error handling. The tasks are organized to enable parallel development where appropriate and follow the required format with checkboxes, IDs, and file paths.
